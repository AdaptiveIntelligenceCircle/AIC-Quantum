# AIC-Quantum Security Policy

Quantum-level systems introduce nonlinear risks.
Security is foundational — not optional.

---

## 🔐 Reporting Vulnerabilities

Report via:

- Private encrypted communication
- Official GPG key (to be published)
- Do NOT open public issues before coordination

---

## 🛡 Security Layers

1. Sandbox execution
2. Simulation isolation
3. Governance audit logs
4. Fail-safe shutdown mechanisms
5. Distributed control (no single root authority)

---

## ⚠ Risk Classification

### Level 1 — Local
Logic bugs, simulation inconsistencies.

### Level 2 — Systemic
Consensus instability, governance breakdown.

### Level 3 — Civilizational
Cryptographic collapse, uncontrolled infrastructure impact.

Level 3 triggers immediate development freeze.

---

## 🧯 Kill Switch Policy

AIC-Quantum must implement:

- Emergency shutdown procedures
- Rollback to last stable state
- Governance override mechanisms

No kill-switch → no deployment.

---

## 🔎 Security Review Cycle

- Quarterly internal audit
- Adversarial simulation testing
- External academic review (when feasible)

---

## 🧬 Post-Quantum Responsibility

If discovery risks breaking global civilian infrastructure:

- Do not disclose publicly
- Coordinate with responsible security institutions
- Pause deployment

---

## 🧠 Final Principle

Quantum security is not about protecting systems.
It is about protecting civilization from ourselves.
