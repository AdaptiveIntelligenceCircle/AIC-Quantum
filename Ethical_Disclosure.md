# ETHICAL_DISCLOSURE.md
AIC-Quantum Ethical Disclosure Statement

Version: 1.0

---

## 1. Foundational Principle

AIC-Quantum is designed under the assumption that:

No autonomous probabilistic system should operate
without explicit ethical constraint and auditability.

---

## 2. Scope of Responsibility

AIC-Quantum influences:

- Decision-making systems
- Trust propagation
- Risk modeling
- Cryptographic identity
- Distributed governance logic

Therefore, its misuse can cause:

- Systemic instability
- Governance manipulation
- Infrastructure compromise
- Ethical drift

---

## 3. Non-Objectives

AIC-Quantum is NOT designed for:

- Autonomous lethal decision systems
- Political manipulation systems
- Social scoring systems
- Surveillance enhancement systems

Deployment in such contexts violates project intent.

---

## 4. Ethical Risk Domains

### 4.1 Power Concentration Risk

High-trust nodes may accumulate disproportionate influence.

Mitigation:
- Trust damping
- Rotational authority
- Distributed validation

---

### 4.2 Algorithmic Bias Risk

Probabilistic collapse mechanisms may encode hidden bias.

Mitigation:
- Entropy auditing
- Open collapse algorithm specification
- Third-party review

---

### 4.3 Governance Capture Risk

Governance layer could be modified to weaken constraints.

Mitigation:
- Immutable core governance principles
- Version-locked ethical policies
- Transparent policy diffs

---

## 5. Human Oversight Requirement

AIC-Quantum must not operate
in fully autonomous irreversible mode
without human review capability.

Kill-switch access must be maintained.

---

## 6. Research Ethics

All experimental models must:

- Avoid real-world harm simulation
- Avoid active exploitation research without containment
- Be documented and reproducible

---

## 7. Transparency Commitment

We commit to:

- Publishing architectural limitations
- Publishing known vulnerabilities (responsibly)
- Encouraging external audits

---

## 8. Moral Position

AIC-Quantum does not claim moral agency.

It enforces constraints defined by human governance.

Final responsibility remains with human operators.

---

## 9. Living Document

This document evolves with:

- Architectural updates
- New risk discovery
- Governance evolution

Ethical stagnation is considered a systemic failure.
