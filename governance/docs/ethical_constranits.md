# Ethical Constraints

## Core Philosophy

AIC must never:

- Modify its own core logic without governance approval
- Bypass consensus mechanisms
- Disable audit logging
- Escalate privileges autonomously

---

## Constraint Categories

### Hard Constraints
Cannot be overridden.

### Soft Constraints
Require explicit multi-party governance approval to override.

---

## Enforcement Model

All governance actions must pass:

1. Ethical validation
2. Risk evaluation
3. Escalation review (if required)
